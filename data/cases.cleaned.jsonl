Enable auto-detection in WPML → String Translation and visit the front-end in a non-default language to help WPML detect and register the strings. 2. If strings are still missing, use WPML → String Translation → Utilities → Admin Texts Translation to find and select strings from theme or plugin options for translation. 3. If strings are not found in Admin Texts, scan the theme or plugin directly from WPML → Theme and plugin localization . 4. Check WPML → Translation Dashboard under Templates or Template Part sections for embedded strings in theme parts. If these steps do not resolve the issue, it might be due to strings being hardcoded in theme/template files or using non-WPML-compatible functions. In such cases, a manual inspection of the texts and their page sources is necessary. We recommend not repeating previously confirmed ineffective steps and considering alternate methods like registering text via WPML hooks or direct gettext review.

For the GeneratePress Elements and other settings, ensure that each element is correctly configured and translated within WPML settings. For pending translations, check the WPML translation management dashboard and finalize any incomplete translations. To ensure WPML flags are visible and correctly rendered, verify the settings in WPML->Languages and adjust the CSS for proper display on desktop and mobile. To position the language switcher correctly in a slide-out menu, use custom CSS to align it horizontally with the menu items.

Ensure the element exists in the original layout and check if it's set to appear based on widget areas or dynamic conditions that might differ on translated pages. 2. If the element is added via a widget, go to Appearance > Widgets and verify if it's present in the language-specific widget areas. 3. If necessary, manually recreate the filter for each translated language. 4. Ensure that all products and categories you wish to filter by are translated into the respective languages. 5.

When adding a translation by clicking the \"+\" sign, choose to copy the content from the original page so you can replace only the parts you need. We advise making a few tests to familiarize yourself with how it works in practice.
